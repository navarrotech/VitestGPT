- React.js support
- Require module support
- Instead of creating a vitest from scratch, instead modify + upgrade it
- Additional context arg, where you can pass a comma separated list of other files to include to the prompts
- Additional information arg, where you can help to tell it the purpose of a given function
- Interactivity, where the GPT can make suggestions to the source code (if it finds a bug)
  - The user will see a git diff, and can approve/deny each change in a diff editor
  - Once all diffs are resolved, then the GPT can retry the unit tests
- Add support for passing a vitest.config.ts into this
  - Maybe even consider our own vitestgpt.config.ts or something lol
  - Add support for auto discovering vitest.config.ts
- Make output path optional, where it will default to the same directory but with a functionname.test.ts instead
