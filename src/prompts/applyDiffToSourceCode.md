Below is a suggested diff edit, using conflict markers:
```
{{ it.diff }}
```

However, the diff might only be a representation of the full source code file.
The diff may not include all the context needed to apply it correctly.

Please re-apply the conflict markers correctly, but to the entire source code file, not just the diff.

Source code file:
```
{{ it.sourceCode }}
```

ONLY return the remodified, full source code file with the conflict markers correctly re-applied.
Do not return any other text or explanation.
Please honor all of the original source code, including any comments or formatting.
